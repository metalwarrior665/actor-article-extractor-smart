  "text": "A woman broke down in tears as she told a court today how a former Tory MP sexually assaulted her at his home while his children were in bed.\n\nThe woman, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, told Southwark crown court that Charlie Elphicke had invited her for a drink in 2007 while his wife Natalie was away on a business trip.\n\nShe said that the children were in bed and she had a cup of tea while Mr Elphicke drank wine in the garden and they chatted.\n\nAfter about an hour, she said, “the weather changed so he suggested they go inside to the lounge” and they shared a £40 bottle of wine.\n\nShe said they carried on talking in the living room"
